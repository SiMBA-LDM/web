                        Text-to-music (TTM) generation models have garnered significant interest, yet their training 
                        from scratch requires extensive GPU resources and large datasets. While finetuning leverages 
                        pretrained weights, it remains limited by the base model's inherent behavior. To make TTM 
                        training more accessible, we introduce a two-stage framework that leverages the coarse-to-fine 
                        structure of audio codec representations. The first stage constructs an autoregressive music 
                        language model (LM) using SiMBA---a state-space model that outperforms Transformer architectures 
                        in efficiency---to generate tokens for the coarse codec layers. The second stage uses a diffusion 
                        model to generate finer-layer tokens conditioned on the coarse tokens, simplifying the LM's task 
                        and enabling the second stage to act as a reusable vocoder. This design enhances flexibility, 
                        allowing experimentation with diverse LM architectures or token conditioning methods. Trained on 
                        a public dataset of 54,894 instrumental track-text pairs, our SiMBA LM with approximately 280M 
                        parameters outperforms its Transformer counterpart in both training efficiency and objective metrics. 
                        Moreover, our user study shows that the proposed model achieves competitive music generation 
                        quality with the official MusicGen-Small model while using only 9% of its FLOPs, making training 
                        feasible on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Then a piano comes in playing a jazzy melody in one scale accompanied by a synth brass sound swelling into existence and playing a short rise before leaving again. This is an amateur recording but of decent audio-quality. This song may be playing in a jazzbar.
